This is the Plaxo plugin for Thunderbird.

I worked on this a few moons ago. I'm putting
it up here on github with other code I've worked
on or am working on.


The copyright is in the code and this is officially a Plaxo 
project. I'm sure they won't mind me putting this up, though.
This is an open source project. I expect more bits to flow
in from them over time.
